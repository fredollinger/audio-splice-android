# Audio Splice Application for Android Software Requirements Specification Document

# Purpose 

An application which will load audio files and allow playing, cutting and
pasting, and deleting parts of a track.

# Overall Description

# Product Perspective

The app will store in memory a file in aac format for editing.

## Product Features

1. opening a file and having it appear as a waveform
2. dragging through the file and selecting a portion for cut/copy
3. pasting it into the output wave.
4. saving audio files
5. deleting part of the audio file
6. copying one part of a audio file onto another
7. playing the audio file
8. recording a new audio file

After which we'll do 'multiple waveforms', then channels. We'll implement that
naively with LinearLayout, but eventually we'll work towards something like a
RecyclerView or implement what the iOS people call a (horizontal) 'Carousel
view' from scratch.
